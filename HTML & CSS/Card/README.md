**Hints:**
- You can get the Inter font [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter).
- You can get a random user’s image from [here](https://randomuser.me/photos).
- The image needs to be 60x60.
- The card is initially rotated 5 degrees counter-clockwise. <br/> When we hover on it, it
  should rotate back to its normal position. <br/> The thumbnail image should also be
  scaled up by 1.15x.
- The colors used for the gradient are #74d690 and #5cbfbb.
- Add a subtle shadow around the card so it’s separated from the page. <br />
  Shadow offset: 0 <br />
  Blur: 20px <br />
  Spread: 30px <br />
  Color: #f9f9f9
- The card needs to have a maximum width of 500px.
